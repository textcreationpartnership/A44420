            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>LEaſt I ſhould be thought ſingular, I ſhall ſay ſomething by way of Preface, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I ſhall anſwer ſome Objections which it is like may be made both againſt the Subject I treat of, and againſt Me for treating of it, as being a work altogether of no uſe.</p>
            <p>The firſt Objecteth againſt the Subject I treat of,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Object. 1. againſt the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>(which is of Fencing, or the Art of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending Ones ſelf with the Small Sword from their Adverſary)</hi> and ſaith, it is not worth the while to underſtand it; becauſe ſaith he, <hi>if it be a Mans Fate to be kill'd, his underſtanding of this Art will never ſave him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Any Rational Man will laugh at this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and think it not worth the Anſwering,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
               </note> but yet I will take the pains to convince them, (if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) who over they are who will have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to make ſuch an Objection, of the contrary by Reaſon; I deny not but what ever Providence or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth is unevitable, yet we are to uſe all the means imaginable to preſerve our Lives as long as we can; otherwiſe we ſhould be careleſs and not provide for our Subſiſtance, nor in any manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend

               </gap>ulous, and the contrary of which we ſee daily practiſed; For when one Country or Kingdom cometh againſt another, do they not now a dayes endeavour to fortifie their Cities, that they think lye moſt open to be attaqued, with all the Art imaginable; As alſo, do they not endeavour to bring as well trained Men to the Field as poſſible, that ſo they may defend themſelves with the more eaſe by their Art, and fight with the leſs confuſion: I am ſure any man that would deny the uſe of Fortification, or the bringing of well Diſciplin'd Men to the Field; and would maintain that a Company of Rabble would come as ſoon to their purpoſe, and defend themſelves as well; If I be not deceived, ſuch a perſon would be accounted very ridiculous. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeing through all the World almoſt, Art is allowed to one Kingdom againſt another, and to one Countrey againſt another, I know no reaſon, and certainly there is no reaſon, why it ſhould not be allowed to one ſingle Man againſt another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But ſaith he,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object. 2d:</hi>
                  </note> what Advantage have thoſe who have practiſed this Art, of others who underſtand nothing at all of it, ſeing that we daily ſee that the underſtanding of this Art hath but little effect; for as oft, yea oftner, thoſe who underſtand this Art, are worſted by Ignorants, then the Ignorants by them, and therefore I think a Man is as
<pb facs="tcp:57272:6"/>well without it as with it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think no rational Man will deny, but when two Men of equal Courage are engaged one againſt the other,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anſwer</hi>
               </note> and the one hath Art and the other none, but it is ten to one,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>That it is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for a man to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand</hi> Fencing.</note> that he that hath no Art be worſted, ſeeing no rational Man can ſay, that a Mans Art in any manner taketh away his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. I confeſs that a compleat Artiſt will not be ſo raſhly forward as a rude Ignorant, and the reaſon is, becauſe when he purſueth he doth it with Judgement, and waiteth an apportunity, which the other cannot; for although he did wait for an opportunity of purſuing, yet not having Art, he would be as far to ſeek after he hath got it, how to make uſe of it, as if he had not got it at all, and it is upon that account that moſt part of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants purſue furiouſly and irregularly, becauſe they know they can have no Advantage by not doing of it, and by chance may have advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by doing of it, if they have to do with one who is but half an Artiſt, you may ſee by this that the Ignorants raſh forwardneſs proceeds from his want of Art; and the Artiſts delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from his having Art: Now ſeing Art taketh not away Courage, then certainly the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt hath this Advantage of the Ignorant (being as I ſuppoſed of equal Courage with the Ignorant) that his Art maketh him to defend himſelf a great deale better, then the other can be expected to
<pb facs="tcp:57272:7"/>do and alſo to purſue better when he hath an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, which the other being ignorant cannot do; and therefore I ſay being of equal Courage, it is ten to one but the Artiſt maſter the Ignorant, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the contrary may fall out; for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing certain in this World. Now I will reduce the Reaſons why that ſometimes falleth out unto <hi>Three.</hi>

But there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a Man that is but grounded, his playing with an Ignorant, and ones playing that really knoweth how to make uſe of his Art with judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: I ſay if an Ignorant meet with ſuch a perſon, he will find that he hath but too too great Advantage of him, if be come to make uſe of <hi>Sharps:</hi> Yet Ignorants will ſometimes overcome thoſe who underſtand this Art very well; and my other two Reaſons which I have yet to ſhew you, are the Reaſons why that falleth out.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:57272:8"/>with the other; And ſo as the Proverb is, <hi>Let it fall upon the Feyeſt;</hi> for neither Art nor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct can be made uſe of by perſons the one of which is Ignorant, and the other wanteth the uſe of his Senſes.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:57272:9"/>for it will bring the Theory again to them which 'tis like they could not have ſo well, nor eaſily attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without the help of a <hi>Maſter,</hi> the advantage of which many cannot have in the Countrey, Yea, nor in many Cities in this Kingdom, there are ſo few in it, and yet more then are well imployed, which is a great diſ incouragement to them; and the Reaſon why we have ſo few of them. Alſo I thought that ſuch a plain peice as this falling into ſuch perſons hands, who farr from having ever ſeen any thing of <hi>Fencing,</hi> 'tis like perhaps did never ſo much as know what it meant, this peice I ſay, falling by chance amongſt their hands, I thought it might be a means to cauſe them be more earneſt after the underſtanding of this Art, and ſo mind them of enquiring after <hi>Fencing Maſters</hi> of whom we have very able Ones in this Kingdom, ſo that we need not be beholden to our Neighbouring Nations for the perfecting of our Youth in this Art, ſeing we have it moſt exactly taught in his Kingdom, and although it be not taught perhaps with ſo good a grace, as abroad, yet I ſay, if a Man ſhould be forced to make uſe of <hi>Sharps,</hi> our <hi>Scots play</hi> is in my Opinion, farr before any I ever ſaw abroad, as for ſecurity; and the Reaſon why I think it ſo, is, becauſe all <hi>French play</hi> runneth upon <hi>Falſifying</hi> and <hi>taking of time,</hi> which appeareth to the Eyes of the Spectatours to be a farr neatter, &amp; Gentiler way of playing then ours but no man that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands

               </note> 
               <hi>That I put my ſelf to an unneceſſary trouble, in treating of a Subject that hath been already treated of by others, and who 'tis like underſtood this</hi> Art <hi>better then I do.</hi> I ſay it is hard to light on a Subject that hath not been in ſome manner treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of by others, but I only begg that this ſmall work of mine may be compared with others of this kind, and then I am confident you will find a great difference betwixt them and this, for in them (at leaſt in all of them that ever I ſaw) you will find a great many things ill Explained, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unneceſſary, beſides that there is ſuch diverſitie of <hi>Leſſons,</hi> with their contraries, and ſo many of them, that it is impoſſible without a great deal of pains, and a vaſt memorie to remember them all; whereas in this there is nothing but the very grounds as it were, and the <hi>Leſſons</hi> upon which this Art depends, ſo that I account a Man that underſtands not the <hi>Leſſons</hi> I have here given him, but an Ignorant, becauſe they are in effect the Quinteſcence of this Art; But upon the contrarie, if he underſtand them, and know exactly how to put them in practice, I account him an Artiſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:57272:11"/>once knowing the grounds by which he is to walk, he will of himſelf find out diverſitie of <hi>Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> together with their contraries to play upon ſuch as are ingaged againſt him, which will be of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er uſe to him then if I ſhould have ſet him down more, which its like would have Emberaſsed his judgment, whereas his own are more natural to him; and providing he obſerve the Directions I ſhall give him, as good. And for thoſe <hi>Authors who have treated of this Subject before their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of this Art better then I do.</hi> I ſhal not deny it; <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe (as I told you before,) I am perhaps more ſenſible of my own weakneſs then you are. <hi>Secondly,</hi> although I had a better opinion of my ſelf then really I have, yet <hi>I</hi> have more of good manners then openly either to diſcommend them, or commend my ſelf; But this much <hi>I</hi> will ſay for my ſelf, that what <hi>I</hi> have here given you in this ſmall Treatiſe, <hi>I</hi> am ſure will be approven of by all who underſtand what <hi>Fencing</hi> is; ſo that I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value what Ignorants can ſay of it, ſeing it was not for ſuch <hi>Criticizing Ignorants,</hi> that I was at the pains to write; For ſuch Ignorants will endeavour to find faults where there are none, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they capable of making any amendement, if there were any, and it is upon that account that <hi>I</hi> undervalue any thing they can ſay, either againſt my ſelf, or againſt what <hi>I</hi> have here write.</p>
            <p>But now, <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The Reaſon of my <hi>putting it in a Dialogue, and not in a continued
<pb facs="tcp:57272:11"/>Diſcourſe,</hi> was that after I had thought what would be the eaſieſt Method I could take,
<note place="margin">

               </note> for to make thoſe of the meaneſt Capacitie underſtand my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; (which is no ſmall trouble) <hi>I</hi> found this of Dialogue in my Opinion to be the beſt and plaineſt; <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe young Beginners, or who ever it be, that is to peruſe this Treatiſe, will underſtand by the <hi>Scholars</hi> Queſtions, the Deſcription of the <hi>Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> better then if I had only diſcourſed of them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Scholar in his Queſtions, beingeth in many things very pertinently, and uſeful to a Beginner, which had I uſed any other Method, could not have been brought in ſo to the purpoſe; But to tell the truth it is a matter of indifference, for this Method I thought beſt, and therefore made uſe of it. 'Tis like their may be as many of my Opinion, as of the contrary, but however let not ſuch a trivial Matter as this make you undervalue the Work, for if it doe, it is a ſigne that neither Dialogue, nor Diſcourſe, would have pleaſed you.</p>
            <p>I need make no Apology for my Stile, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of which I treat requiring but a Courſe, Plain and Eaſie one, ſo all that I am to begg of you <hi>Gentle Reader,</hi> is that when you are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſing this ſmall Work, you would not be too critical, but if you meet with any thing a miſs, which I am hopefull you will not, paſs it over, conſidering the pains I have been at, is for your improvement which I am confident will Anſwer both our Expectations, providing you ſeriouſly conſider, and obſerve the Directions which follow.</p>

                  <p>Sir, You have found out exactly the hazard that a Man is in, in holding his Sword after that manner, but when you hold it, as I have before told you, you muſt hold it faſt and firm, and not gently, ſo that your Adverſary with the leaſt ſudden <hi>beat</hi> or twiſt may force it out of your hand.</p>

                  <p>The hazard of holding it looſly is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57272:21"/>this,
<note place="margin">The Reaſons why a Man ſhould not hold his Sword too looſly in his hand.</note> that when once you get a habit of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſword ſo, if you ſhould have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to play with ſharps, you will be in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of having it ſtruck out of your hand, which may put your life in hazard.

                     <hi>Indeed it is ſo, and now when I conſider it; Although a Man had not ſuch a Strong reaſon as that you have given me to cauſe him hold his Sword faſt, yet Peoples very laughing at men when they are playing with blunts, becauſe they ſee at every other Thruſt their Flurett beat out of their Hand, ſhould be a ſufficient argument to them to cauſe them hold it faſt, and</hi> I <hi>my ſelf when I have ſeen them quite with their Flurett ſo eaſily, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I underſtood nothing of this Art my ſelf, yet I thought it very un-handſome, and laughed at them as being as Ignorant of this Art as my ſelf.</hi>

                  <p>You had good reaſon to do ſo, and yet I have ſeen ſome who underſtood little or nothing of this Art, <hi>beat</hi> the Flurett out of their Adverſaries hand, although he was very far above their play.</p>

                  <p>The Reaſon why that ſometimes falleth out, is becauſe he that is playing with ſuch an Ignorant, knoweth himſelf to

                  <p>The good it doth is, that of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity it cauſeth you turn out your left Thigh, and therefore maketh your Body ſo much the thinner, for when the Broad ſide of your Foot is towards your Adverſary, you can by no means turn out your left Thigh, and ſo conſequently it will be ſeen, or open to your Adverſary to thruſt at, and therefore in hazard of being wounded, which your would have prevented had you turned out your left Toe; you muſt remember alſo when you ſtand to your <hi>Guard</hi> this way to Sink as cloſs to the Ground with your breech as poſſible, without Thruſting of it out.

                  <p>The Advantage you have by Sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is alſo conſiderable, for when you Sink as I deſire you, that part of your Body which is betwixt the <hi>Hilt</hi> of your Sword &amp; your right thigh is quite covered, which, when you keep your <hi>Guard</hi> after the French
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57272:26"/>way is quite diſcovered and open: You muſt alſo remember when you Stand to your <hi>Guard</hi> this way, to bow both your Knees alike, and reſt equally with your Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die upon both your Thighs, as in the Second Figure of the ſecond Plate; you are to keep the reſt your Body, according to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections I gave you for the French way: At firſt this <hi>Guard</hi> is a little uneaſie, but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cuſtom will make it become as eaſie to the Body, as the foregoing Poſture.</p>

Now to make your <hi>Feint,</hi> without any Motion of your Foot to them, is moſt reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, becauſe the making of it, as quick as you can, without any beat of your Foot will cauſe them believe that it is really a <hi>Thruſt,</hi> coming in upon that ſide on which you make your <hi>Feint,</hi> and ſo cauſe them anſwer it, and then you have your deſign. But the matter is farr different, when you are playing with Ignorants, or with ſuch who are in a manner but juſt grounded in this <hi>Art,</hi> for if you ſhould make a <hi>Feint</hi> to them without giving a beat with your Foot, upon the ground, they would not anſwer

For your <hi>Feint</hi> without a beat of your Foot with it, would appear to them as no <hi>Feint</hi> at all, becauſe of the quickneſs of the Motion, whereas upon the contrary, if you gave a beat with your <hi>Feint,</hi> you would ſurprize them, and in a manner make them ſtart, when you made your <hi>Feint,</hi> and ſo make them go to the <hi>Parade,</hi> which was your deſign.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57272:49"/>but when you make uſe of your Left Hand, and if you make right uſe of it, you will find it ſave you from a great many <hi>Contre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temps,</hi> which otherwiſe you would have received; But let not this cauſe you truſt all to your Left Hand, and nothing to your Sword, for if you do that, it had been better for you that I had not given you the foregoing Advice: Which, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs I can aſſure you is very good, if you onely make uſe of it as a help to your <hi>Parade</hi> with the Sword, and not alone, for alone it is dangerous, but together with your Sword moſt ſafe and excellent.</p>

                     <p>There are two kinds of <hi>Incloſing,</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> kind is done, by runing cloſe to your Adverſarie,

                        </note> The <hi>ſecond</hi> is when a man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteth his Adverſary, by playing the ſame or the like <hi>Leſſon</hi> upon his Adverſary, which his Adverſary deſigned to play upon him, and to make uſe of this <hi>ſecond</hi> occaſion right, a man muſt be ſure to be <hi>before</hi> his Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that is to ſay, whatever <hi>Leſſon</hi> he deſignes to prevent his Adverſaries <hi>Leſſon</hi> with, he muſt have it played before his Adverſary hath played his, otherwiſe it will be a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre-temps,</hi> as for example, if your Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſhould offer to give you in a <hi>Plain

                     <p>This is a very pertinent Queſtion, and I ſhall quicklie according to my own opinion reſolve it to you; I think then either for <hi>Purſuing</hi> or <hi>Defending,</hi> the <hi>Quart Guard, with a ſtreight point,</hi> abſolutelie without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon the beſt. For if you intend to be the <hi>purſuer,</hi> then without debate this <hi>Guard</hi> is
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57272:87"/>the beſt, becauſe when you keep it, you are in a readier poſture for <hi>offending,</hi> then when you keep any of the other <hi>four;</hi> and if you intend to be the <hi>defender,</hi> then alſo is it the beſt, both becauſe you are in as ready a poſture to <hi>defend,</hi> as when you keep any of the other, and alſo becauſe in it as well as in any of the other, you may make uſe of your Left Hand, ſo it hath this advantage of the reſt, that when you keep it, your Body is more at liberty, and not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to obſerve one poſture, and one <hi>Parade,</hi> as you muſt do for the moſt part, when you keep any of the reſt, for they are more proper for the <hi>Defenſive part,</hi> then for the <hi>purſuit;</hi> yet next the <hi>Quart Guard with a ſtreight point,</hi> I eſteem the <hi>Terce Guard, with the point higher then the Hilt,</hi> next to it is the <hi>Terce Guard with the point lower then the Hilt,</hi> to be choſen, next to it is the <hi>Quart Guard, with the point ſloping towards the Ground,</hi> and laſt of all, is the <hi>Fifth Guard,</hi> which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the <hi>Defenſive part,</hi> eſpecially when a Mans ſword-hand is wearied, this is my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion as to the choice of a <hi>guard</hi> for ſafety, yet there may be ſome of another opinion, but every Man chooſeth the <hi>guard</hi> he hath moſt liking to: and ſo I leave it to you, to make your chooſe alſo; according to

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sir, I think there is all the reaſon imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that I ſhould, for ſeing I am not ſo able to judge of the goodneſs, and badneſs of them as you are, why ſhould I not then approve of your choice? But Sir, I will yet put you to the trouble, of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering me one Queſtion, before you proceed to thoſe rules, you were juſt now ſpeaking of; and that is, if two men of equall Art, and courage, were engaged againſt other, the one with a Broad Sword, and the other with a Small, which of them,
<note place="margin">That the <hi>Small ſword</hi> hath the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the <hi>Broad.</hi>
                           </note> in your opinion would have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage?</hi>

                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>Sir there is very little difficulty in anſwering of this Queſtion, for there is no rationall man that underſtandeth both the Art of the <hi>Small Sword,</hi> and the <hi>Broad,</hi> but will confeſs that the <hi>Small</hi> hath a very great advantage of the other, if theſe who are to make uſe of thoſe different kinds of ſwords be engaged for their lives, and the reaſon is this, that a man with a <hi>Small Sword,</hi> may <hi>Contre-Temps</hi> with him that hath the <hi>Broad,</hi> ſo that each of them receiveth a wound, but he that had the <hi>Broad Sword</hi> ſhall be killed, becauſe there can be but few wounds given with the <hi>ſmall Sword,</hi> in a mans Body, but
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57272:88"/>what prove mortall, whereas a man may receive many cutts in the Body, yea, even in the Head, with a <hi>Broad Sword,</hi> which will not be mortall, yea even hardly ſo diſabling, as that a Man with a <hi>ſmall ſword</hi> may not (betwixt the time of his receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his wound, and being diſabled) kill his Adverſary, but I aſſure you, if a Man be run thorow with a <hi>ſmall-Sword,</hi> it either immediatly killeth him or diſableth him ſo, that he can hardly keep his feet, let alone to reſiſt any longer.</p>

                        <hi>Truely Sir your argument is very ſtrong, and in my opinion, there can little be ſaid againſt it, yet I have heard thoſe in their Schools, who taught the Broad-Sword, ſay that they would hitt a Man oftner with the Broad Sword, or Cudgell, then a Man could hitt them with a ſmall ſword or Flourret?</hi>

                     <p>I ſhall likewiſe eaſily anſwer you as to that, <hi>Firſt</hi> every Man endeavoureth to maintain the excellency of the Art he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth above other Arts of that nature, as much as poſſible, that ſo he may be the better imployed, and really a Man can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be condemned for ſo doing, <hi>Secondly</hi> in playing with <hi>Blunts,</hi> I think the <hi>Cudgell</hi> hath as farr the advantage of the <hi>Flourret,</hi> as in <hi>ſharps</hi> the <hi>ſmall-ſword,</hi> hath of the <hi>broad,</hi>
                        <pb n="119" facs="tcp:57272:88"/>and my reaſon is, becauſe one good ſmart blow, of a <hi>bazle ſtick</hi> is worth a dozen of Thruſts given with a <hi>Flourret,</hi> and ſo is a Thruſt with a <hi>ſmall-ſword,</hi> which is right planted, worth half a dozen, yea I may ſay a dozen of ſuch wounds as ordinarly people who underſtand the <hi>broad ſword</hi> receive when they are playing with <hi>ſharps:</hi> But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> as for a Man's hitting oftner with the <hi>cudgell</hi> then another who underſtandeth the Art of the <hi>ſmall-ſword,</hi> will with a <hi>Flourret,</hi> I alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether deny it, unleſs a Man can hitt oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with the <hi>Broad-ſword,</hi> or <hi>cudgell</hi> without being hitt by his Adverſary, then his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary with a <hi>ſmall-ſword,</hi> or <hi>Flourret</hi> can hitt him without being hitt himſelf, I ſay unleſs he hitt without being hitt himſelf with a <hi>Contre-temps,</hi> or upon the <hi>reſpoſt,</hi> he cannot be ſaid to hitt oftener. Now if he be playing with one that is Maſter of the <hi>ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſword.</hi> I poſitivelydeny, that ever he will hitt him without receiving a Thruſt, either by way of <hi>Contre-temps</hi> or upon the <hi>reſpoſt,</hi> if he with the <hi>ſmall-ſword</hi> have a mind for it; which if he do, he cannot be ſaid to hit oftner, and ſo conſequently, his Art is not better: I know that the grounds of the Art of the <hi>Broad Sword</hi> are almoſt the ſame, with the grounds of this Art, but ſtill when a man commeth
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57272:89"/>to practiſe with <hi>ſharps,</hi> the <hi>ſmall ſword</hi> hath the advantage, both becauſe of the reaſons I juſt now gave you, and alſo becauſe it's Motions are a great deal more Subtil, and quicker, then thoſe of the <hi>Broad Sword,</hi> and I appeal to any rational indifferent perſon, if what I ſay be not grounded upon Reaſon, but for all this, I am ſo farr from under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing the Art of the <hi>Broad Sword,</hi> that upon the contrary I think it both very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and pleaſant, and hath it's own uſe as well as the <hi>Small,</hi> for as upon Foot the <hi>Small</hi> is moſt commonly uſed (although it be alſo very uſefull upon <hi>Horſe-back,</hi>) ſo upon <hi>Horſe-back</hi> is the <hi>Broad</hi> moſt ordinarly to be made uſe of, and I really think that all Gentlemen ſhould underſtand, how to <hi>Defend</hi> themſelves with both, for a Man can never be called a compleat Sword-Man, untill he can <hi>Defend</hi> himſelf with all kindes of Swords, againſt all ſorts his Adverſary can chooſe againſt him.</p>

For before I can ſtrick at you to doe you any harme, I muſt firſt come within reach of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57272:95"/>you, and if I be within reach of you, you will alſo be within reach of me; for it is not to be expected, that a man can <hi>Judge</hi> his Adverſaries <hi>Meaſure</hi> as exactly upon <hi>Horſe-back,</hi> as he can doe upon <hi>Foot,</hi> to cauſe himſelfe be within reach of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſarie, and yet his Adverſarie without reach of him, which if he be an Artiſt he may doe upon <hi>Foot</hi> but not upon <hi>Horſe back;</hi> therefore if I muſt before I can touch you, be within reach of you, and when I am within reach of you, you are alſo within reach of me; then certainly who ever is the beſt <hi>Sword Man</hi> ſhould carry it, ſo that my Maſtering of you dependeth not ſomuch upon the goodneſs of my Horſe as upon the ſwiftneſs of my <hi>Parade</hi> and <hi>Stroak,</hi> then ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe after I have given a ſtroak at you, I ſhould go off you again, I may if I pleaſe make my Horſe go from hand to hand twenty times, but what ſignifieth it, ſeing before that I can do you any harme I muſt have you within my reach, and when you are ſo, I am within yours, ſo as I ſaid before, our Maſtering of each other depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon <hi>our own Art,</hi> and not upon our <hi>Horſes</hi> being <hi>Well</hi> or <hi>ill Managed,</hi> I conclude then that in a <hi>ſingle fight</hi> upon <hi>horſe-back</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the ſword, and that alſo only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two perſons, <hi>a Managed horſe</hi> is but
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57272:95"/>little if any advantage at all;

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57272:96"/>ſo now the great uſe of a <hi>Managed Horſe,</hi> is either in a <hi>Battel,</hi> or where you are to make uſe of your <hi>Piſtols,</hi> for if you are to make uſe of your <hi>Sword only,</hi> then there will be no great miſs of him, and that for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I before told you; Now the reaſon why I deſired you at firſt to provide a <hi>well mouth'd Horſe,</hi> was becauſe as I told you in the begining of this diſcourſe, people now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes ſeldome or never make only uſe of their <hi>ſwords</hi> upon <hi>Horſe-Back,</hi> but <hi>firſt</hi> of their <hi>Piſtols,</hi> and then of their <hi>ſwords,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that being the cuſtome, I think a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged Horſe</hi> abſolutely neceſſary, but were it not upon that account, I think the want of one might be diſpenſed with, I have now I ſuppoſe ſatisfied you as to that doubt.</p>

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57272:102"/>and folly, in ſtruggling for your ſword, when you know your Adverſary is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of it, and ſo conſequentlie of you.

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57272:105"/>Art, would almoſt alwayes have the worſt, if they were to ingage againſt <hi>ſtronger</hi> then themſelves, if the uſe of the left hand, and <hi>Breaking of Meaſure,</hi> be not allowed to them, which <hi>two Inconveniences</hi> I prove as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Firſt</hi> that all Art with the Sword-Hand alone would ſignifie but little, is moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident thus, let the ableſt <hi>Fencing Maſter</hi> in Chriſtendom be engaged againſt a <hi>Foreward Ignorant,</hi> and the <hi>Fencing Maſter</hi> neither al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to <hi>Parie</hi> the <hi>Ignorants thruſts</hi> with his Left hand, nor to <hi>Breake his Meaſure,</hi> then in an inſtant they either <hi>Contre-temps</hi> upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or <hi>Incloſe,</hi> and if they do either, then the <hi>Ignorant</hi> may be ſaid to have as much the Advantage as the other, for if they <hi>Contre-tempts,</hi> there is no reaſon why the <hi>Ignorants thruſt</hi> ſhould not be as mortal as the <hi>Fenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Maſters:</hi> And if they <hi>Incloſe</hi> then ſtill the ſtrongeſt muſt carry it, which proveth the <hi>Second Inconveniency,</hi> in not allowing the uſe of the left hand, and the <hi>Breaking of Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> to <hi>Weak men</hi> againſt <hi>Strong,</hi> for they have nothing to <hi>Defend</hi> themſelves with, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe who are <hi>Stronger</hi> then them but their <hi>Art,</hi> which can ſignifie almoſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to them if the <hi>Breaking of Meaſure,</hi> and the uſe of their left hand be not allowed, and ſo it is ten to one, but the <hi>Strongeſt</hi> Man

But here I am af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid ſome perſons may be ſo farr miſtak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, as to think that what I have here ſaid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecteth ſomewhat upon the uſefulneſs of this Art, becauſe that I am in a manner letting them ſee, that a Man having no Art may be almoſt as ſafe when he is attacqued, either by an <hi>Ignorant</hi> or <hi>Artiſt,</hi> as one who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth this Art exactly can be when he is attacqued by either, and that by reaſon of the <hi>Ignorants Contre-temping,</hi> or <hi>Incloſing;</hi> but let not ſuch perſons be deceived, for if they but reflect a little upon what I have been ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they will find that to make the <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> in equall terms with the <hi>Artiſt,</hi> I have ſuppoſed two of the chiefeſt <hi>Defences</hi> in the Art of the <hi>Smal-Sword,</hi> not to be allowed the <hi>Artiſt,</hi> which almoſt no rationall Man will but allow him, and thoſe are the <hi>Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Meaſure,</hi> and the uſe of the left-hand for a <hi>Parade,</hi> now although I know that many will yet ſtickle at the allowing the <hi>breaking of meaſure,</hi> notwithſtanding of all that I have ſaid, both to ſhew the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of allowing it, and the ridiculouſnes of crying out againſt it, yet there is no Man I am ſure ſo unreaſonable, as not to allow the other, which is <hi>the Parieing with the left<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,</hi>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:57272:107"/>for if he allow not that, he may as well allow no defence at all, and if he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, then <hi>Art</hi> will ſtill be ſerviceable to any Man, againſt <hi>Ignorants</hi> of what ever <hi>Humour</hi> they be, becauſe thoſe who have <hi>Art</hi> will by it know how to make <hi>uſe of their left-hand,</hi> which the others being <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> cannot, and ſo conſequently let an <hi>Artiſt</hi> be engaged againſt an <hi>Ignorant</hi> in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo little bounds, where perhaps he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>Break meaſure</hi> although he would, yet ſtill by his art he hath an advantage of the <hi>Ignorant,</hi> becauſe by it he knoweth both to <hi>Defend</hi> himſelf with his <hi>Sword,</hi> and <hi>left-hand,</hi> a great deal better then the <hi>Ignorant</hi> can be ſuppoſed to doe, never having been taught it.

                  <p>Now Sir, There is one thing which I would never have you want, and that is a well <hi>mounted ſword</hi> by your ſide, that is to ſay,
<note place="margin">How to know when a Sword <hi>is well mounted.</hi>
                     </note> which is light before the Hand, you may eaſily try if it be ſo, by only laying it croſs your foremoſt Finger about three inches from the <hi>Shell,</hi> and then if the <hi>Hilt contre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe</hi> the <hi>Blade,</hi> it is <hi>well mounted,</hi> otherwiſe not; and alſo let it be of an indifferent good <hi>length</hi> which is about three quarters of an eln long in the <hi>Blade,</hi> this is a midle betwixt the two extreams, for it is neither <hi>too long,</hi>
                     <pb n="162" facs="tcp:57272:112"/>which would be unhandſome; nor <hi>too ſhort,</hi> which is very inconvenient: For I can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you that if a Mans <hi>Arm</hi> be longer then his Adverſaries, he hath by it ſome Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, although their Swords be of <hi>equal length,</hi> ſo ſeing there is Advantage in a <hi>long Arm,</hi> certainly there is more in a <hi>long Sword</hi> againſt a <hi>ſhort.</hi> I will now give you my <hi>laſt Advice</hi> which I know many People will treat <hi>en ridicule;</hi> But I aſſure you, let People think or talk what they pleaſe, it is of greater importance then they imagine, and were it not out of Kindneſs to you, perhaps I would not ſo expoſe my ſelf to their Cenſure; But ſeing I know it will be for your Advantage, I will proceed in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it you, and undervalue what People may talk of me for it,
<note place="margin">An advice not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary as ſome people may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</note> eſpecially ſeing you nor no Man is forced to obſerve more of what I have been ſaying to you, then what you think is for your Advantage. Now my <hi>Advice</hi> is this, <hi>That you would never go to the Field in drink; but rather if you can by any means (without puting a taſh upon your Honour) delay it until you be ſober; For to Drunk and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Men this Art ſignifieth but little or nothing, becauſe neither of them have their Judgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them to know how they ſhould make uſe of it;</hi> And ſo I end.</p>

            <p>I Have now kind Reader, (for I cannot well o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wayes call you, who have done me the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to peruſe this ſmall Piece) if I be not deceived, made good the Tittle Page, and if you ſeriouſly conſider it, ſomewhat more; therefore if you reap not Advantage by what you have read, blame not me, for I have given you the Directions, which is all lyeth in my Power to make you a <hi>Sword-Man,</hi> and if you put them not in practice the fault is your own; for you muſt not expect that the ſimple reading of what I have here given you, will ever make you a <hi>Sword-Man;</hi> No no, it is practice that muſt do that; its true your read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this little Piece may make you talk, and diſcourſe learnedly enough of <hi>Fencing;</hi> But what will that avail a Man, when he is either to make uſe of <hi>Blunts</hi> or <hi>Sharps?</hi> Certainly in ſuch a caſe <hi>Theorie</hi> without <hi>Practice</hi> will ſerve but for little: It is therefore <hi>Practice</hi> joyned with it which in ſuch a caſe muſt do the buſineſs; Reading therefore will as I ſaid give you the <hi>Theorie,</hi> which is alſo abſolutely neceſſary for a <hi>Sword-Man,</hi> but it is <hi>Practice</hi> which muſt
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57272:113"/>make you Act thoſe things I have here given you, ſo that without it your Reading will ſignifie but very little: Therefore I again give you the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which I once gave you before, and that is, <hi>That you would get exactly by heart any Leſſon you intend to Practiſe, and when you have it ſo, then fall to the practiſing of it, either upon a</hi> Fencing Maſters <hi>Breaſt, which certainly is the beſt way if you can have one, or otherwiſe upon a Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rads.</hi> This is the only way to reap Advantage by the <hi>Scots-Fencing-Maſter,</hi> you may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerve it if you pleaſe; And if obſerving it exactly it anſwer not your expectation, I ſhall then willingly acknowledge my puting you to unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary trouble: But upon the other hand I earneſtly beg that you would not condemn me before you have made a tryall, and even then if all ſhould not anſwer your expectation as you imagined, yet in ſuch a caſe I deſire a favourable cenſure, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I have imparted to you the ſmal knowledge I have my ſelf of this Art, and that it is not to be expected that a Man can give more then he hath to himſelf. I therefore expect of thoſe who are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judges of what I have here written, that they will keep their Judgement to themſelves, untill they be able firſt to find a Fault if there be any, and then to amend it, for I know many will endeavour to find Faults, which they are not able
